# Team-Profile-Generator

# Description
This project uses JavaScript, npm inquirer and npm jest to generate a HTML file when node index.js is run in the command line and the input fields are answered. The generated HTML file will display information about members of an employment team including the manager, engineers and interns. An employee class was created and the manager, engineer and intern classes all extended from it.

# Installation
Run npm install

# Usage
To use this project, the command terminal needs to be opened and node index.js needs to be inputted. After that, prompt questions will be displayed for information about the manager of the team. Once those questions have been answered a menu will be displayed asking to add more team members or finish building the team. If engineer or intern are chosen more questions will be displayed, but if the finish building team option is chosen then a HTML file will be generated.
